This file is intented for people wishing to run Trelby using the sources,
i.e., not using a released package. This means mostly developers who want
to inspect/modify the code.

1. Requirements
===============

You will need Python (2.6 or 2.7) and wxWidgets (2.8) and its Python
bindings to run Trelby. You also need the lxml Python library
(http://lxml.de/).

To build the manual, you will also need xsltproc.

2. Preparing data files
=======================

Trelby needs special preparation for 3 of its data files. If you do not do
this, that aspect of the program will not work.

 * Name list

  $ make names.txt.gz

 * Dictionary

  $ make dict_en.dat.gz

 * Manual (PDF)

  $ make manual.pdf

You can run "make dist", which prepares all 3 and also generates a Linux
distribution package which you can ignore.

2.5. Preparing for a Windows build
================================
If you're looking to package for Windows, you'll need to place the windows
redistributable runtime file vcredist_x86.exe in the blyte directory.

be sure to have the following installed:
 * python-2.7.2.msi
  - py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.7.exe
  - wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.12.1-py27.exe
  - nsis-2.46-setup.exe
  - lxml-2.3.win32-py2.7.exe
  - pycrypto exe

If you go with python 2.6, get the relevant py2exe and wxpython as well.

Install vcredist_x86.exe locally. On Win Vista/7, msvcp90.dll will not be
under windows/system32, but under windows/winsxs. Hunt this file down,
and copy it over to system32. This just causes duplication, nothing else,
but is required so nsis won't complain about a missing DLL.

Finally ensure you had run make dist in the directory on a linux machine,
so all files are in place. (and ensure vcredist_x86.exe is here as well)

Then, on windows, to get the installer:
1) cd <blyte directory>
2) build.bat
4) nsis.bat

Your freshly created Setup-Trelby-<version>.exe should be ready.


3. Running Trelby
=================

On Linux:

 $ cd ~/blyte/src
 $ ./blyte.py --test

On Windows:

 $ cd \blyte\src
 $\python23\python blyte.py --test sample.trelby

 (Substitute correct path to python.) The file t.bat contains the
 last command.

4. Differences from packaged versions
=====================================

The "--test" command line argument makes Trelby differ from normal running
as follows:

 -No splash window is displayed on startup.

 -No global directory locations are used; configuration/state files
 instead go under ".trelby" in the current directory.

 -Unhandled exceptions are not caught and reported in a dialog box,
  instead, they are printed normally to stderr.

 -The following characters activate special behavior:

  -"å": Load "sample.trelby".

  -"¤": Call function MyCtrl.cmdTest.

  -"½": Time how long 50 screen refreshes take.

   (The above characters are in the ISO-8859-1 character set.)
