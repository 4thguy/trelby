This file is intented for people wishing to run Blyte using the sources,
i.e., not using a released package. This means mostly developers who want
to inspect/modify the code.

1. Requirements
===============

You will need Python (at least 2.3) and wxWidgets (2.4 or 2.6) and its
Python bindings to run Blyte.

To build the manual, you will need:

 -HTML: xsltproc

 -PDF: FOP

2. Preparing data files
=======================

Blyte needs special preparation for 3 of its data files. If you do not do
this, that aspect of the program will not work.

 * Name list

  $ make names.dat

 * Dictionary

  $ make dict_en.dat.gz

 * Manual (PDF)

  $ make manual.pdf

You can run "make dist", which prepares all 3 and also generates a Linux
distribution package which you can ignore.

3. Running Blyte
================

On Linux:

 $ cd ~/blyte/src
 $ ./blyte.py --test

On Windows:

 $ cd \blyte\src
 $ \python23\python blyte.py --test sample.blyte

 (Substitute correct path to python.) The file t.bat contains the
 last command.

4. Differences from packaged versions
=====================================

The "--test" command line argument makes Blyte differ from normal running
as follows:

 -No splash window is displayed on startup.

 -No global directory locations are used; configuration/state files
 instead go under ".blyte" in the current directory.

 -Unhandled exceptions are not caught and reported in a dialog box,
  instead, they are printed normally to stderr.

 -The following characters activate special behavior:

  -"å": Load "sample.blyte".

  -"¤": Call function MyCtrl.cmdTest.

  -"½": Time how long 50 screen refreshes take.

   (The above characters are in the ISO-8859-1 character set.)
