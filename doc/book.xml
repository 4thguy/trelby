	<title>Introduction</title>

	<para>This is the manual for the &blyte; screenwriting software. This
	  version of the manual corresponds to version &blyte.version; of the
	  software.</para>

  <chapter>
	<title>Basic usage</title>

	<para>This chapter discusses the basic usage of the program.</para>

  </chapter>

  <chapter>
	<title>Other commands</title>

	<para>This chapter describes commands not discussed in other
	chapters.</para>

	<sect1>
	  <title>Script/Find next error</title>

	  <para>'Find next error' searches through the script, starting from
	  the cursor position, looking for errors. This means that to search
	  the entire script for errors you should first position the cursor at
	  the beginning of the script.</para>

	  <para>If it finds any errors, it positions the cursor on the line
	  containing the error and displays a message box detailing the error.
	  You should fix the error, back up a few lines, and activate the
	  command again to search for more errors. Alternatively, if you don't
	  want to fix the error right now, move the cursor down one line if
	  you want to search for more errors.</para>

	  <para>It can detect the following errors:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>

		<listitem>

		  <para>Empty line, or a parenthetical element containing only
		  ().</para>
		  
		</listitem>

		<listitem>

		  <para>A character element that is not followed by a
		  parenthetical or a dialogue element.</para>

		</listitem>

		<listitem>

		  <para>A parenthetical element that does not follow a character or
		  a dialogue element.</para>
		  
		</listitem>

		<listitem>

		  <para>A dialogue element that does not follow a character or a
			parenthetical element.</para>
		  
		</listitem>
		
	  </itemizedlist>
	  
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	  <title>Script/Paginate</title>

	  <para>'Paginate' simply repaginates the script. You normally don't
	  need to run this if you have automatic repagination enabled, but the
	  command is available for use when automatic repagination is disabled
	  or you want immediate repagination after a large cut/paste
	  operation.</para>
	  
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	  <title>Script/Title pages</title>

	  <para>'Title pages' allows you to edit your script's title pages.
	  You can have as many title pages as you want, or none at all.</para>

	  <para>At the top of the window are add/delete/move/next buttons.
	  'Add' adds a page, 'Delete' deletes the current page, 'Move' swaps
	  the current page with the next page, and 'Next' changes the view to
	  the next page.</para>

	  <para>The strings listbox contains all text strings for the current
	  page. Select the text string you want to edit in this listbox, and
	  use the add/delete buttons to add/delete text strings.</para>

	  <para>On the right side of the listbox is a coarse preview showing
	  the approximate location of text strings on the current page, with
	  the selected text string shown in red.</para>
	  
	  <para>At the bottom of the window are the settings for the selected
	  text string. There's the text itself, the position of its upper left
	  corner as an offset from the paper's upper left corner, font, size,
	  and style. 'Centered' means that the text is centered horizontally
	  on the page.</para>

	  <para>Finally there's a 'Preview' button that you can use to get an
	  accurate preview of all of the title pages.</para>
	  
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	  <title>Script/Headers</title>

	  <para>'Headers' allows you to edit your script's headers. Headers
	  are lines that are automatically added to the top of each page of
	  the script, excluding title pages and the first page of the actual
	  script.</para>
	  
	  <para>Topmost in the window is a setting for how many empty lines
	  you want inserted after your header lines.</para>
	  
	  <para>After that is a listbox of all the strings in your headers.
	  Select the text string you want to edit in this listbox, and use the
	  add/delete buttons to add/delete text strings.</para>
	  
	  <para>Below the listbox are the settings for the selected string.
	  You can adjust the string text, style, alignment, line and
	  positioning.</para>

	  <para>The text is first positioned according to the alignment
	  setting, and then its horizontal starting position is adjusted by
	  the number of characters given in 'X offset'. Note that this
	  parameter can be negative, so for example, if you want your header
	  string to start 2 characters before the left margin, select
	  'Alignment: Left' and 'X offset: -2'.</para>
	  
	  <para>Any occurrences of '${PAGE}' in the text string will be
	  replaced by the page number in the actual headers.</para>
	  
	  <para>Finally there's a 'Preview' button that you can use to get an
	  accurate preview of your headers.</para>
	  
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	  <title>Tools/Name database</title>

	  <para>'Name database' opens a window allowing you browse and search
	  through a database of more than 200,000 character names, each name
	  being categorized by its nationality and sex.</para>

	  <para>On the left side of the window is a list of the name
	  categories. The main groups available are nationalities, but there
	  are some other interesting groups, e.g. Shakespeare, Medieval,
	  Flowers etc.</para>
	  
	  <para>Select the groups you want to search in, either a single one
	  by simply clicking on it, or multiple ones by holding down CTRL and
	  then clicking on multiple items. If you want to go back to the
	  default of having all the groups selected, press the 'Select all'
	  button at the bottom of the list.</para>
	  
	  <para>On the upper right side of the window are the other search
	  parameters. There's a text box in which you can write the text you
	  want to search for, and two radio button groups.</para>
	  
	  <para>The first one affects how your search string is used. The
	  string has to match either a) at the start of the name, b) anywhere
	  in the name or c) at the end of the name.</para>
	  
	  <para>The second one selects whether male/female/both names are
	  included in the search results.</para>
	  
	  <para>The search is always case-insensitive, and a blank search
	  string matches all names.</para>
	  
	  <para>After having set all the search parameters, press the 'Search'
	  button, at which point the results list will change to contain only
	  the names matching the search parameters. A count of the matching
	  names is shown at the bottom of the window.</para>

	  <para>You can select names from the result list and press 'Insert'
	  to insert that name at your script at the current cursor
	  position.</para>

	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	  <title>Tools/Character map</title>

	  <para>'Character map' opens a window allowing you to insert any
	  character from the supported ISO-8859-1 (i.e. Latin-1) character set
	  into your script.</para>
	  
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	  <title>Tools/Compare scripts</title>

	  <para>You need two different versions of the same script open to use
	  'Compare scripts'. Select the older one as the first script and the
	  newer one as the second script. The program then goes through the
	  scripts looking for changes between them and displays the results as
	  a PDF file.</para>

	  <para>The PDF file contains only changed parts of the script. The
	  changes are color coded: Deleted lines are red, added lines are
	  green, non-changed lines (shown for context) are white, and marker
	  lines for single-line changes are yellow. The changed parts are
	  separated by two gray lines.</para>
	  
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	  <title>Help/Commands</title>

	  <para>'Commands' opens a window showing all the keyboard
	  commands.</para>
	  
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	  <title>Help/Manual</title>

	  <para>'Manual' opens this manual you're reading right now.</para>
	  
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	  <title>Help/License</title>

	  <para>The license submenu contains three commands for dealing with
	  licenses:</para>

	  <variablelist>
		
		<varlistentry>
		  <term>Information</term>
		  <listitem>
			<para>Shows information about the current license.</para>
		  </listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
		  <term>Update</term>
		  <listitem>
			<para>Opens a file dialog allowing you to load a new
			license.</para>
		  </listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
		  <term>Release</term>
		  <listitem>
			<para>Releases your license, i.e. goes back to evaluation
			  mode.</para>
		  </listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		
	  </variablelist>
	  
	</sect1>
	
	<sect1>
	  <title>Help/About</title>

	  <para>'About' opens the about screen for the program, showing
	  information such as the version and the date the program was
	  released on.</para>
	  
	</sect1>
	
  </chapter>

  <chapter>
	<title>Importing existing screenplays</title>

	<para>Existing screenplays can currently be imported from only one
	file format: as formatted ASCII text. The following section documents
	the format these files should have for optimal import
	processing.</para>
	
	<sect1>
	  <title>ASCII Text files</title>
	  
	  <para>ASCII text files should have the following
	  characteristics:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>

		<listitem>
		  
		  <para>Each element style should begin at a unique column. An
		  exception is that Scene and Action can begin at the same
		  column.</para>

		  <para>There should only be one such starting column per element
		  style, i.e. all dialogue should begin at the same column, it
		  shouldn't sometimes start at column 25, sometimes at 27,
		  etc.</para>
		  
		</listitem>

		<listitem>

		  <para>No production markings, e.g. scene numbers, page numbers,
			cast lists, or anything like that.</para>
		  
		</listitem>

		<listitem>

		  <para>Elements should be separated by a single empty
		  line.</para>
		  
		</listitem>
		
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>Below is a short example of the kind of format best recognized
	  by the program.</para>
	  
	  <screen>
EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

The package hits the water and is submerged. A few seconds
later, a rapidly inflating liferaft appears.

The people land into the water in their parachutes. They
dispose of them and swim toward the liferaft.

INT. LIFERAFT - NIGHT

They're all aboard, taking off their clothes. When they're
all naked, Sarah gathers the wet clothes, throws them out,
and closes the entrance to the tent-like liferaft. The men
openly admire Sarah's body, as she opens a storage locker
and takes out dry clothes for everyone which they then put
on.

                      KEVIN
          I know a great way to warm up.

                      SARAH
          Sorry, I got over the "older men"
          thing a while back.

                      KEVIN
          Anytime you have a flashback, let
          me know.

Something starts beeping.

	<title>Reports</title>

	<para>This chapter discusses the various report types &blyte; can
	  generate.</para>

	<sect1>
	  <title>Dialogue chart</title>

	  <para>'Dialogue chart' first opens a window allowing you to specify
	  what to include in the generated chart. The 'Sorted by:' options
	  select what orderings to include, while the 'Characters appearing on
	  a single page' option, if unselected, leaves out all characters
	  appearing on a single page only from the generated chart. It's
	  useful for long scripts that have many such characters, or otherwise
	  if you want to concentrate on the more important characters.</para>

	  <para>It then generates a chart in PDF format with one page for each
	  selected ordering and shows that.</para>

	  <para>The chart has two axes: The horizontal one, with page numbers
	  increasing from left to right, and the vertical one, with characters
	  ordered by the current page's sort criterion from top to
	  bottom.</para>

	  <para>If a character speaks on a given page, he will have a black
	  mark on that page's position on the chart.</para>

	  <para>Every other line has a light gray background to allow easier
	  visual matching of distant markings to character names.</para>

	  <para>You can use this chart in many ways. For example, you can at a
	  glance see if your side characters disappear for 50 pages in the
	  middle of the script, whether your main characters appear on nearly
	  all pages or not, etc etc.</para>

	  <para>At the top is another chart, this one showing the dialogue
	  density for each page. Dialogue density is calculated as "number of
	  dialogue/character/parenthetical lines on page divided by total
	  number of non-empty lines on page". By looking at the chart you can
	  easily see where the action scenes are by the lower dialogue density
	  in those pages.</para>
	  
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	  <title>Character report</title>

	  <para>'Character report' first opens a window allowing you to
	  specify what to include in the generated report. You can select what
	  characters are included, and what kind of information to include for
	  each character:</para>

	  <variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
		  <term>Basic information</term>
		  <listitem>
			<para>Total number of speeches, total number of lines, the
			percentage of all the dialogue lines in the script that this
			character speaks (i.e. 25% would mean this character has
			one-fourth of the total dialogue in the script), average
			number of lines per speech, total words, average number of
			words per speech and average number of characters per word.
			</para>
		  </listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
		  <term>Page list</term>
		  <listitem>
			<para>Number of pages this character speaks on, followed by a
			list of all of those pages.</para>
		  </listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
		  <term>Location list</term>
		  <listitem>
			<para>A list of all the locations this character speaks in,
			preceded by the number of lines spoken at each
			location.</para>
		  </listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		
	  </variablelist>

	  <para>It then generates a report in PDF format containing the
	  selected information and opens that file.</para>
	</sect1>
