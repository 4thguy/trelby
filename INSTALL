Installation instructions for Trelby on Linux
---------------------------------------------

You have to copy all the files (excluding INSTALL and Makefile) to
/opt/blyte. Afterwards you can run the program with the command
"/opt/blyte/blyte.py".

The supplied makefile copies everything to the right place if you run
"make install". It requires root access (assuming /opt is not
writable with normal user permissions) and WILL DO "rm -rf
/opt/blyte", so be sure there's nothing important stored there.

See the website (http://www.trelby.org/) for the requirements for running
Trelby on Linux.
