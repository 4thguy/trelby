Installation instructions for Blyte on Linux
--------------------------------------------

You have to copy all the files (excluding INSTALL and Makefile) to
/usr/local/blyte. Afterwards you can run the program with the command
/usr/local/blyte/blyte.

The supplied makefile copies everything to the right place if you run
"make install". It requires root access (assuming /usr/local is not
writable with normal user permissions) and WILL DO "rm -rf
/usr/local/blyte", so be sure there's nothing important stored there.

See the website (http://www.oskusoft.com) for the requirements for running
Blyte on Linux.
