-when entering scene heading text, after some x characters are
written, the program should search through the entire script to find
existing scene headings with matching starts, and if there are less
than n matches, display some kind of helpful popup-window or something
allowing you to easily insert one of the existing ones. maybe the
choices are numbered alt-1 - alt-0, and then pressing that key selects
that one, inserts it, and positions cursor at end of line.
