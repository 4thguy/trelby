-pml->pdf font baseline wrong for non-courier fonts?

-add suffix automatically if missing in save/export

-remove wxIsUnicode, we can now depend on it always being true

-use staticmethod decorator for static functions

-should probably have menu commands for switching the element's type, once
 the combobox is deleted. otherwise only way to do it through keyboard
 commands.

-change default fonts on linux to something that actually makes sense on
 modern distros

-update locations to look for adobe acrobat; also, there may be better
 ways of finding a program to launch for PDFs nowadays
