-pml->pdf font baseline wrong for non-courier fonts?

-add suffix automatically if missing in save/export

-remove fromGUIUnicode and toGUIUnicode and all calls to them, they are
 now no-ops

-use staticmethod decorator for static functions

-should probably have menu commands for switching the element's type, once
 the combobox is deleted. otherwise only way to do it through keyboard
 commands.

-update locations to look for adobe acrobat; also, there may be better
 ways of finding a program to launch for PDFs nowadays

-move some/all of GlobalData/MyPanel/MyCtrl/MyFrame out of blyte.py

-rename: blyte -> trelby

-settings dialog for colors should have a "restore default" button for
 each item

-try using graphics contexts for tab ctrl drawing to get anti-aliased
 lines (http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_graphics_context.html)

-check if it would make sense to store the name database in .zip format.
 it would be a bit bigger but much faster to decode, plus we're not a
 commercial program anymore so we don't care at all about obfuscating the
 storage format.

-check windows uninstall doesn't leave any files behind etc (why does it
 try to delete python23.dll still?)

-go through README/INSTALL/t.bat etc and make sure nothing references
 python2.3 anymore

-move *.py into src/
