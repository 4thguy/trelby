-pml->pdf font baseline wrong for non-courier fonts?

-add suffix automatically if missing in save/export

-move some/all of GlobalData/MyPanel/MyCtrl/MyFrame out of trelby.py

-version information needs to be updated in way too many places. figure
 out a way to have it in as few places as possible so it's easier to
 update.

-try using graphics contexts for tab ctrl drawing to get anti-aliased
 lines (http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_graphics_context.html)

-go through README/INSTALL/t.bat etc and make sure nothing references
 python2.3 anymore
