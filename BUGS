if you have:

>.JIM and JASON, two men in their thirties, are standing
>.inthe middle of an empty warehouse. The place looks

and you position the cursor over 't', third letter of second row, and
press space, nothing happens, even though it should rewrap the whole
element, and 'in' will now fit on the first line. this is because the
rewrap code currently does not consider lines above current line in
the element at all. and this is because it doesn't handle keeping
cursor position correct if wrapping begins somewhere other than on the
current line.
